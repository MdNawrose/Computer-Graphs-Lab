## 📌 About
This repository contains my **Computer Graphics Lab codes** and practice programs. It includes classic drawing algorithms, 2D/3D transformations, clipping techniques, filling algorithms, curve generation, and basic OpenGL demos. The repository is primarily designed for academic learning, lab assignments, and hands-on practice.

---

## 🚀 Topics Covered
- **Drawing Algorithms:** DDA, Bresenham Line, Midpoint Circle, Ellipse
- **2D/3D Transformations:** Translation, Rotation, Scaling, Shear, Reflection
- **Clipping:** Cohen–Sutherland, Liang–Barsky, Sutherland–Hodgman
- **Filling Algorithms:** Flood Fill, Boundary Fill, Scanline Fill
- **Curves:** Bezier, B-Spline (basic implementations)
- **OpenGL Demos:** Simple graphics, animations, and input handling

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** C, C++, Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** OpenGL, GLUT (Matplotlib/Pygame for Python demos)  
- **Platforms:** Linux/Windows (tested with `freeglut` & `glew`)
